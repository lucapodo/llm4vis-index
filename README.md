## LLM4VIS Introduction

Following the disruptive use of generative artificial intelligence across application domains, LLM4VIS (Large Language Model for Visualizations) is becoming one of the most promising research areas to advance existing NL2VIS approaches. LLM4VIS aims to use cutting-edge LLM technology to query data sources using only natural language queries and translate them into visualizations that accurately represent the underlying data. Although LLM like Llama or GPT, have shown a more advanced semantic understanding of free text, they suffer from the lack of interpretability of the model‚Äôs responses. Furthermore LLM, those involving computationally intensive and expensive architectures containing billions, and recently trillions of parameters, also have other contraindications, such as hallucinations, the lack of controllability and interpretability, and the high computational cost, hindering their large-scale adoption in applications. In particular, controllability has a notable, and often neglected, impact on applications: if a certain model is based on the adaptation of a proprietary LLM, such as GPT, the evolution of the original LLM could significantly impact the adapted model. This means that developers of a model based on a proprietary LLM do not have full control of their system.

This repository is dedicated to offering the latest advancements in this emerging field, serving as an updated resource for the community to enhance their research endeavors. We are committed to regularly updating and maintaining this repository to ensure accessibility to state-of-the-art knowledge

## LLM4VIS hypercube dimensions
An LLM4VIS method is crafted to integrate an LLM into one or more steps of a data visualization pipeline. In this section, we offer a list of dimensions/categories that can aid in constructing a new method/model/strategy. This repository presents dimensions identified from the diverse approaches discussed here. Hence, an LLM4VIS methodology can be defined by a hypercube consisting of the following dimensions:
1. **üìö Learning Strategy (Fine-tuning/Few-zero-shot learning)**: This dimension defines the methodology used for model training.
2. **üéØ Task-Agnosticism**: This dimension assesses whether the model's input encompasses only the dataset or incorporates user utterances.
3. **ü§ñ Approach**: This dimension distinguishes between a pure LLM approach and one enriched with additional tools or methodologies.
4. **ü©ª Output Explainability**: This dimension determines whether the model merely provides a visualization or includes a narrative to elucidate the reasoning strategy.
5. **üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Effort**: This dimension quantifies the computational and strategic effort required to generate the output.

By leveraging these dimensions, it becomes feasible to categorize and evaluate all proposed approaches in the literature, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in this domain.

However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, the task has been decomposed into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, a dataset has been created consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. | Text2Vis |

The authors analysis reveals that users most frequently experience dissatisfaction when ChatGPT fails to grasp their intentions, while they rate the severity of dissatisfaction related to accuracy the highest. The authors also identified four tactics users employ to address their dissatisfaction and their effectiveness. The authors found that users often do not use any tactics to address their dissatisfaction, and even when using tactics, 72% of dissatisfaction remained unresolved. Moreover, the authors found that users with low knowledge of LLMs tend to face more dissatisfaction on accuracy while they often put minimal effort in addressing dissatisfaction. Based on these findings, the authors propose design implications for minimizing user dissatisfaction and enhancing the usability of chat-based LLM. |
