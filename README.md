## LLM4VIS: Difference between the Two Approaches with and without the Wrapper

### Leveraging Language Models as Data Scientists approaches: From Pure Text to Executable Code

In the realm of data science, Language Models (LMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various tasks, both as standalone entities and in conjunction with coding environments like Python. Here's a brief overview of what can be achieved using LMs in both scenarios:

- Pure LLM Approach: LLMs can sift through large volumes of textual data, extracting key insights, trends, and patterns without the need for additional agents or components.
- LLMs with Code Environment Integration: LLMs can generate code snippets for tasks like data cleaning, transformation, and normalization, which can then be executed within a coding environment to prepare data for analysis.
